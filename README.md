# PEGAS-kRPC
Port of PEGAS-MATLAB to python with kRPC integration

From the kRPC folder, you should be able to run python Main.py

You'll want to set the target orbital parameters there too.

There's primitive logic to figure out how to fly the rocket, but for more complex examples, you'll want to create the vehicle structure in code, rather than having it deduced from the kRPC vessel object.
